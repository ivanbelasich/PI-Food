After a couple of minutes, stir and spread out again.,Add cold rice (it separates easily, so it won't clump up during cooking), plus the additional grapeseed and coconut oil or butter. Raise heat to medium-high. Toss everything together and, again, spread the mixture out over the whole pan and press a bit into the bottom.,Let it sit for about two minutes—so the rice can get toasted and a little crispy.,Add the peas and broccoli and stir again.,Drizzle soy sauce and toasted sesame oil over rice.Cook for another minute or so and turn off heat.,Add chopped scallion tops and toss.I like to toast some sesame seeds in a dry pan; I sprinkle these and some more raw, chopped scallion over the top of the rice for added flavor and crunch.Season to taste with salt and, if you'd like, more soy sauce.
